/**
 * Base class for a node in a Pipeline or Graph. The interface is only a concept, and does not have
 * any actual functionality. Its subclasses could be Estimator, Model, Transformer or AlgoOperator.
 * No other classes should inherit this interface directly.
 *
 * <p>Each stage is with parameters, and requires a public empty constructor for restoration.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: every Stage subclass should have a no-arg constructor.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: every Stage subclass should implement a static method with signature {@code static T
 * load(StreamTableEnvironment tEnv, String path)}, where {@code T} refers to the concrete subclass.
 * This static method should instantiate a new stage instance based on the data read from the given
 * path.
 *
 * @param <T> The class type of the Stage implementation itself.
