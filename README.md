Flink ML is a library which provides machine learning (ML) APIs and
infrastructures that simplify the building of ML pipelines. Users can implement
ML algorithms with the standard ML APIs and further use these infrastructures to
build ML pipelines for both training and inference jobs.

Flink ML is developed under the umbrella of [Apache
Flink](https://flink.apache.org/).

## <a name="start"></a>Getting Started

You can follow this [quick
start](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-ml-docs-master/docs/try-flink-ml/quick-start/)
guideline to get hands-on experience with Flink ML.

## <a name="build"></a>Building the Project

Run the `mvn clean package` command.

Then you will find a JAR file that contains your application, plus any libraries
that you may have added as dependencies to the application:
`target/<artifact-id>-<version>.jar`.

## <a name="benchmark"></a>Benchmark

Flink ML provides functionalities to benchmark its machine learning algorithms.
