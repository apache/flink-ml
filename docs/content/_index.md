# Flink ML: Apache Flink Machine Learning Library

Flink ML is a library which provides machine learning (ML) APIs and
infrastructures that simplify the building of ML pipelines. Users can implement
ML algorithms with the standard ML APIs and further use these infrastructures to
build ML pipelines for both training and inference jobs.
