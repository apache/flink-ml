# Building And Installing Flink ML From Source

This page covers how to build and install Flink ML from sources.

## Build and Install Java SDK

In order to build Flink ML you need the source code. Either [download the source
of a release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) or [clone the git
repository](https://github.com/apache/flink-ml.git).

In addition, you need **Maven 3** and a **JDK** (Java Development Kit). Flink ML
requires **at least Java 8** to build.

To clone from git, enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-ml.git
```

The simplest way of building Flink ML is by running:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

This instructs [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (`mvn`) to first remove all
existing builds (`clean`) and then create a new Flink ML binary (`install`).

After the build finishes, you can acquire the build result in the following path
from the root directory of Flink ML:

```
./flink-ml-dist/target/flink-ml-*-bin/flink-ml*/
```

The `mvn clean install` command would have installed the binary into your local
Maven repository so other projects can refer to it and grab it from the
repository. There is no additional step required for installation.

## Build and Install Python SDK

### Prerequisites

1. Building Flink ML Java SDK 

   If you want to build Flink ML's Python SDK that can be used for pip
   installation, you must first build the Java SDK, as described in the section
   above.

2. Python version(3.6, 3.7, or 3.8) is required
   ```shell
   $ python --version
   # the version printed here must be 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with the following command:
   ```shell
   $ python -m pip install -r flink-ml-python/dev/dev-requirements.txt
   ```

### Installation

Then go to the root directory of Flink ML source code and run this command to
build the sdist package of `apache-flink-ml`:

```shell
cd flink-ml-python; python setup.py sdist; cd ..;
```

The sdist package of `apache-flink-ml` will be found under
`./flink-ml-python/dist/`. It could be installed as follows:

```shell
python -m pip install flink-ml-python/dist/*.tar.gz
```
