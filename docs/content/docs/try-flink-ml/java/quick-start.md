# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using Flink ML. Readers of this
document will be guided to submit a simple Flink job that trains a Machine
Learning Model and uses it to provide prediction service.

## Help, Iâ€™m Stuck!

If you get stuck, check out the [community support
resources](https://flink.apache.org/gettinghelp.html). In particular, Apache
Flink's [user mailing
list](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists) is consistently
ranked as one of the most active of any Apache project and a great way to get
help quickly.

## Prerequisites

Make sure Java 8 or a higher version has been installed in your local machine.
To check the Java version installed, type in your terminal:

```shell
$ java -version
```

## Download Flink

[Download 1.15 or a higher version of
Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html), then extract the archive:

```shell
$ tar -xzf flink-*.tgz
```

## Set Up Flink Environment Variables

After having downloaded Flink, please register `$FLINK_HOME` as an environment
variable into your local environment.

```bash
cd ${path_to_flink}
export FLINK_HOME=`pwd`
```

## Add Flink ML library to Flink's library folder

You need to copy Flink ML's library files to Flink's folder for proper
initialization. 

{{< stable >}}

Please [download the correponding binary
release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) of Flink ML, then extract the
archive:

```shell
tar -xzf flink-ml-*.tgz
```

Then you may copy the extracted library files to Flink's folder with the
following commands.

```shell
cd ${path_to_flink_ml}
cp ./lib/*.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

{{< /stable >}} {{< unstable >}}

Please walk through this [guideline]({{< ref
"docs/development/build-and-install#build-and-install-java-sdk" >}}) to build
Flink ML's Java SDK. After that, you may copy the generated library files to
Flink's folder with the following commands.

```shell
cd ${path_to_flink_ml}
cp ./flink-ml-dist/target/flink-ml-*-bin/flink-ml*/lib/*.jar $FLINK_HOME/lib/
```

{{< /unstable >}}

## Run Flink ML example job

Please start a Flink standalone cluster in your local environment with the
following command.

```bash
$FLINK_HOME/bin/start-cluster.sh
```

You should be able to navigate to the web UI at
[localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/) to view the Flink dashboard and see
that the cluster is up and running.

Then you may submit Flink ML examples to the cluster as follows.

```bash
$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -c org.apache.flink.ml.examples.clustering.KMeansExample $FLINK_HOME/lib/flink-ml-examples*.jar
```

The command above would submit and execute Flink ML's `KMeansExample` job. There
are also example jobs for other Flink ML algorithms, and you can find them in
`flink-ml-examples` module.

A sample output in your terminal is as follows.

```
Features: [9.0, 0.0]    Cluster ID: 1
Features: [0.3, 0.0]    Cluster ID: 0
Features: [0.0, 0.3]    Cluster ID: 0
Features: [9.6, 0.0]    Cluster ID: 1
Features: [0.0, 0.0]    Cluster ID: 0
Features: [9.0, 0.6]    Cluster ID: 1

```

Now you have successfully run a Flink ML job.
