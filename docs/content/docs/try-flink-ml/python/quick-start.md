# Quick Start

This document provides a quick introduction to using Flink ML. Readers of this
document will be guided to submit a simple Flink job that trains a Machine
Learning Model and use it to provide prediction service.

## Prerequisites

Python version (3.6, 3.7, or 3.8) is required for Flink ML. Please run the
following command to make sure that it meets the requirements:

```shell
$ python --version
# the version printed here must be 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8
```

## Installation of Flink ML Python SDK

Flink ML Python SDK is available in
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/apache-flink-ml/) and can be installed as
follows:

{{< stable >}}

```bash
$ python -m pip install apache-flink-ml=={{< version >}}
```

{{< /stable >}} {{< unstable >}}

```bash
$ python -m pip install apache-flink-ml
```

{{< /unstable >}}

You can also build Flink ML Python SDK from sources by following the
[development guide]({{< ref "docs/development/building" >}}).

## Run Flink ML example job

After setting up Flink ML Python SDK, you can run a Flink ML example job as
follows.

```shell
$ python -m pyflink.examples.ml.clustering.kmeans_example
```

The command above would create a Flink mini-cluster and execute Flink MLâ€™s
`kmeans_example` job. There are also example jobs for other Flink ML algorithms,
and you can find them in `pyflink.ml.examples` module.

A sample output in your terminal is as follows.

```
Features: [9.6,0.0]     Cluster Id: 0
Features: [9.0,0.6]     Cluster Id: 0
Features: [0.0,0.3]     Cluster Id: 1
Features: [0.0,0.0]     Cluster Id: 1
Features: [0.3,3.0]     Cluster Id: 1
Features: [9.0,0.0]     Cluster Id: 0

```

Now you have successfully run a Flink ML job.
