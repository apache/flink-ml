    A Transformer that transforms a set of categorical or numerical features into
    a sparse vector of a specified dimension. The rules of hashing categorical
    columns and numerical columns are as follows:

    For numerical columns, the index of this feature in the output vector is the
    hash value of the column name and its correponding value is the same as the
    input.

    For categorical columns, the index of this feature in the output vector is
    the hash value of the string "column_name=value" and the corresponding
    value is 1.0.

    If multiple features are projected into the same column, the output values
    are accumulated. For the hashing trick, see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing for details.
