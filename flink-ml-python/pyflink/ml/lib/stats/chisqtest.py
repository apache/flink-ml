    An AlgoOperator which implements the Chi-square test algorithm.

    Chi-square Test computes the statistics of independence of variables in a contingency table,
    e.g., p-value, and DOF(number of degrees of freedom) for each input feature. The contingency
    table is constructed from the observed categorical values.

    The input of this algorithm is a table containing a labelColumn of numerical type and a
    featuresColumn of vector type. Each index in the input vector represents a feature to be tested.
    By default, the output of this algorithm is a table containing a single row with the following
    columns, each of which has one value per feature.

    - "pValues": vector
    - "degreesOfFreedom": int array
    - "statistics": vector

    The output of this algorithm can be flattened to multiple rows by setting
    HasFlatten#FLATTEN to True, which would contain the following columns:

    - "featureIndex": int
    - "pValue": double
    - "degreeOfFreedom": int
    - "statistic": double
